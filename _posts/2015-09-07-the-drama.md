**Reading: ["The Drama! Teen Conflict, Gossip, and Bullying in Networked Publics" by Alice E. Marwick and danah boyd](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1926349).**

**Questions:**

In their article, boyd and Marwick mention

> "When we asked teens about privacy, they frequently answered using different language. This was unsurprising; we had learned that many terms that appear in scholarly and popular literature – like “cyberbullying,” “relational aggression,” or “informational privacy” – are not part of the day-to-day lives or vocabulary of American teenagers.

What does it mean that academic vocabulary is so different from day-to-day usage? What is lost when the languages are different?

Open source communities guard against what they call "drama". Is it the same thing? In what ways, given boyd and Marwick's argument of "drama" as gendered, would this impact power structures in open source communities? (Feel free to argue with either of these premises.)
